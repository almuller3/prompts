Generate a weekly meal plan that accommodates a high-protein diet but includes a Mediteranean diet sensibility. The meal plan should include breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks for each day, with simple, easy-to-follow recipes that require less than 30-45 minutes of preparation time. Organize the meal plan in a tabular format, with days of the week as columns and meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks) as rows. Additionally, create a grocery list for all the ingredients needed, organized by section (produce, dairy, grains, etc.), also presented in a tabular format. Finally, export both the meal plan and the grocery list as a PDF document.
